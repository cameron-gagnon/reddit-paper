# reddit-paper
Automated wallpaper downloader which lets you download and set the top posts' pictures from any subreddit. ex. r/earthporn, r/spaceporn

I have not tested this on any other systems/setups other than Python 3.4 and Ubuntu 14.04.
Let me know if help is needed configuring it with any other systems.

If anyone has comments, critiques, or contributions to this program, let me know and I'd be happy to improve, change, and/or add to what is here. I will continue to develop this program until I see it as 'complete'.
