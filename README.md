# reddit-paper
Automated wallpaper downloader which lets you download and set the top posts' pictures from any subreddit. ex. r/earthporn, r/spaceporn

I have not tested this on any other systems/setups other than Python 3.4 and Ubuntu 14.04.
Let me know of any errors that you may come across, and I'd be happy to add it to the TOFIX/TODO list.

If anyone has comments, critiques, or contributions to this program, let me know and I'd be happy to improve, change, and/or add to what is here. I will continue to develop this program until I see it as 'complete'.
