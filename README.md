Automated wallpaper downloader which lets you download and set the top posts' pictures from any picture filled subreddit. ex. r/earthporn, r/spaceporn, r/imaginarystarscapes

[**Windows Download Here**](https://github.com/cameron-gagnon/reddit-paper/releases/download/0.9/Reddit.Paper-1.1-win32.msi)

Mac and Linux distros will be coming soon.

I have not tested this on any other systems/setups other than Python 3.4 and Windows
I'm sure there are still some bugs in the program, let me know of any you come across and I'd be happy to add it to the list. 

If anyone has comments, critiques, or contributions to this program, let me know and I'd love to improve, change, and/or add to what is here. I will continue to develop this program until I see it as 'complete'. In the end I aim to have a GUI as well, mostly for the learning experience but also for the useabilty to others.


**NOTE:** At the end of the program when run from the command line only, it will always terminate with something of the sort "sys:1: ResourceWarning: unclosed <ssl.SSLSocket fd=5 ..." this is does not indicate an error in the program, it is, from my understanding, the way that PRAW handles the connection that it terminates in this way.

**TODO LIST:**
* Finish Mac/Linux support
